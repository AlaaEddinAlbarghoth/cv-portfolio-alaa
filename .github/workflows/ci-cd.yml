## üöÄ Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Pipeline
## ========================================
## This GitHub Actions workflow automates the entire lifecycle:
## - Linting, type checking, and formatting
## - Running unit and E2E tests (Playwright)
## - Building the app
## - Running security and performance audits
## - Deploying to staging or production
## - Generating coverage and Lighthouse reports
